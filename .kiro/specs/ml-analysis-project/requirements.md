# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves performing a comprehensive machine learning analysis using an open-source dataset with minimum 500 observations. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation to demonstrate understanding of machine learning workflows and model comparison.

## Glossary

- **Dataset**: A collection of structured data with minimum 500 observations used for machine learning analysis
- **Target Variable**: The dependent variable that the models will predict
- **Predictor Variables**: Independent variables (features) used to make predictions
- **Training Set**: 70% of the data used to train machine learning models
- **Testing Set**: 30% of the data used to evaluate model performance
- **ML System**: The complete machine learning analysis system including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation components
